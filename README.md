# Description

___

Lacuna Software developer challenge for admission. The original README for this challenge can be
read [here](https://gene.lacuna.cc/). But in short its a challenge to build a solution that does three things:

* Decode a strand of DNA
* Encode a strand of DNA
* Check if a strand of DNA is a activated in a strand of DNA

All the above operations will be done through Lacuna Software's own REST API.

# The initial solution

___
Here's a diagram that I came up with to describe the initial solution:

# Results

___

If all went well, all the requests given by the API should have been completed successfully.

## Challenges

___

So, this was my first time ***ever*** working with **C#**, at first it was pretty challenging getting used to the
language,
I've worked with REST APIs before, most of my experience is with the **Spring Framework** in Java, so my previous
knowledge helped a lot. I think that this whole, using a language for the first time, was the biggest challenge for me.
But once I got that out of the way, the rest was pretty smooth sailing.

Other than that, it took me a while until I could come up with a satisfying solution that was organized and easy to
understand, drawing the diagram helped me a lot in visualizing the problem and how to tackle it.
